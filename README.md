# Project Name Lab Class 07 Servers with Node and Express

**Author**: Jeffrey Smith
**Version**: 2.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application allows a user to search a city. A display shows the user a map along with links to data about the city weather and movies.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

* React
* Bootstrap React and Bootstrap

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

08-22-2022 4:00pm - Application calls LocationIQ API and uses the data received to display the city, county, country, and coordinates of the city. A map is also displayed.

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Time Estimates
For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

Name of feature: Errors: As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hr

Start time: 9:00  am

Finish time: 10:00 am

Actual time needed to complete: 1 hour

---

Name of feature: Map: As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.

Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hr

Start time: 4:00 pm

Finish time: 9:00 am

Actual time needed to complete: I don't know

---

Name of feature: Form

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hr

Start time: 2:00 pm

Finish time: 3:30 pm

---
Name of feature: City Display

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hr

Start time: 3:30 pm

Finish time: 5:00pm

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
